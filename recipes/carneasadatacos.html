        <h3>---How to make this <em>delicious</em> dish---</h3>

            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 LBS flank steak <em>- skirt steak okay too</em></li>
                    <li>The juice of 1 orange</li>
                    <li>The juice of 2 limes</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of light beer</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp of Soy Sauce</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>Fresh ground pepper <em>- to taste</em></li>
                    <li>1 large white onion <em>- sliced</em></li>
                    <li>Vegetable oil to brush grill before grilling</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the flank steak in a large baking dish and, if using the sliced onion, spread the slices over the meat.</li>
                    <li>In a medium-sized bowl mix together the orange juice, lime juice, light beer, Kikkoman soy sauce, vegetable oil, and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Pour the marinade over the meat; cover with a plastic film and refrigerate for at least one hour.</li>
                    <li>Light up your charcoal grill, or preheat your gas grill. (You can also use a cast iron grill pan, the ones you use over the stove top). And brush your grill with a little vegetable oil as this will prevent the meat from sticking.</li>
                    <li>Remove meat from marinade and pat dry. Place meat on the grill and cook for 8 to 10 minutes per side. (Cooking time will depend on the meat thickness and your personal preferences, either medium or well done). Remove meat from grill and place it on your cutting board. Slice it and serve it with corn tortillas and other garnishes mentioned above.</li>
                    <li>If you would like to have the same effect as that of the Mexican-American restaurant, place the cooked meat on a preheated cast iron pan, add a few drops of  Soy Sauce and serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>

        <h3>Tips for achieving the most authenthic taste:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use charcoal when grilling</li>
                <li>The fresher the ingredients, the better (Think fresh garlic and fresh squeezed lime juice -  instead of from a bottle or prepared from a jar.)</li>
                <li>Marinade for at least an hour (If you have time, overnight is best - especially for thicker cut meat.)</li>
                <li><strong>EAT IT HOT!</strong> (Meat is best enjoyed right off the grill, so prepare everyithing in advance so you can eat the meat right off the grill.)</li>
                <li><strong>BONUS:</strong> If you would like to have the same effect as that of the Mexican-American restaurant; place the cooked meat on a preheated cast iron pan, add a few drops of  Soy Sauce and serve immediately!</li>
