    <p id="intro">A little about me, <em>and why you should try these recipes</em>:</p>
        
    <p id="intro">Over the years I have really enjoyed Mexican food. Finding some truly enjoyable dishes however, has been a journey all on its own. My grandma is Mexican, and though I have never really been close to her or the same nationality; the holiday visits to her house had me easily addicted to the special flavorings only Mexican food can bring.</p>
        
    <p id="intro">My journey was furthered when I met my wife and discovered her apatite for Mexican food. In short order my journey and desires for good Mexican food became coupled with my wife’s, and we quickly realized that we could cook some authentic tasting dishes in our own home! – most restaurants in our area are very Americanized.</p>
        
    <p id="intro"><em>Just for the record</em>; Americanized Mexican food isn’t bad, it just isn’t the same. Most of you that have tried the difference will attest to this.</p>
        
    <p id="intro">I have learned quickly through my recipe journey that the best recipes are the simplest – real Mexican food leaves you satisfied without that bloated feeling.</p>

    <p class="descript"><em>NOTE: I have placed a chile pepper </em>( 🌶️ )<em> next to the spicy stuff </em>🤠</p>
